# UnderstandingTCellsInCancer
Analysis of gene expression data to determine the roles of T cells in cancer

The data used for this project is all from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The cancer types used for the analysis were chosen based on their number of samples with matching control types (roughly 30+ cancer/control pairings for a given cancer type).

"AvgGeneExpTCells.R" is a variety of functions used for comparing expression of T cell markers across different T cells and different cancer types

"DiffExpTCellGenes.R" is a differential gene expression analysis of a number of genes enriched in T cells, as given by the human protein atlas, link to the gene used -
